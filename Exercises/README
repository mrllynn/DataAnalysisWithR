# File name convention
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The files are named as in the "Lecture" folder. The order of the files (the numbering) is also according to the "Lecture" files.
xx_E_S_[...] are the Exercise related files for STUDENTS.
xx_E_T_[...] are the Exercise related files for the TEACHER.

Wile changing xx_E_T_[...]  files to xx_E_S_[...] files make sure to add the following lines to the .Rnw files:
# For students files:
opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, results = "hide", include = FALSE)

# Notes on KnitR chunk options
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Code Evaluation: eval: (TRUE; logical)
# Text Results: echo: (TRUE; logical or numeric) whether to include R source code in the output file; TRUE/FALSE completely turns on/off the source code
# results: results = "hide"
# include: (TRUE; logical) whether to include the chunk output in the final output document
